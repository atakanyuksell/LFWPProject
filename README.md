This is a real project I developed for a law firm. This project, developed with ASP.NET Core 6, is not yet fully ready. Therefore, while browsing the internet, I didnâ€™t want anyone visiting the site abdulhakimogullari.com to encounter a careless design. As a result, I added a login page to the entry. However, the site owners can log in at any time and share their requests and ideas regarding the design.

Additionally, I am sharing the admin username and password below so that everyone who views this repository can check the live version of the site.
